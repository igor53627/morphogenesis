# Mandatory Development Tooling

This file confirms that morphogenesis requires:

## Tools

1. **backlog.md** (v1.35.4+)
   - Task management with git integration
   - MCP server at http://127.0.0.1:7373
   - Tasks located in `backlog/`

2. **roborev** (v0.23.1+)
   - Continuous code review
   - Auto-triggered via post-commit hook
   - Claude skills integration enabled

## Git Hook

`.git/hooks/post-commit` runs:
- zoekt-git-index (search indexing)
- roborev enqueue (automatic review)
- backlog task edit (auto-link commits to tasks)

## Verification

Run to verify setup:
```bash
backlog task list           # Should show tasks
roborev list               # Should show review history
cat .git/hooks/post-commit # Should contain all 3 integrations
```

## Usage

Every commit:
1. Include "Addresses TASK-X" in commit message
2. Hook auto-links commit to task
3. Hook triggers roborev review
4. Review findings appear in `roborev list`
5. Address findings with `roborev address JOB_ID`
